                    <p class="lead">Folly Beach offers the ideal setting for private celebrations of all kinds. Located just 12 miles from downtown Charleston on a barrier island along South Carolina's Atlantic coast, this laid-back beach community combines stunning ocean views, vibrant nightlife on Center Street, and the perfect mix of privacy and accessibility.</p>
                    
                    <p>Known as "The Edge of America," Folly Beach provides a unique atmosphere for bachelorette <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/michchs-mtp-parties/index.html">parties</a> , birthday celebrations, anniversary getaways, girls' weekends, guys' trips, milestone celebrations, and reunion parties. The island's six miles of coastline, iconic Folly Beach Pier, and casual beach vibe make it distinctly different from the more formal atmosphere of downtown Charleston or the upscale resort feel of nearby Kiawah Island and Isle of Palms.</p>
                    
                    <p>Private <a href="https://delightful-wave-0b184070f.1.azurestaticapps.net/">parties</a> on Folly Beach can be hosted in oceanfront beach house rentals along East Ashley Avenue and West Ashley Avenue, at venues near the Edwin S. Taylor Fishing Pier, in properties around the Folly Beach County Park on the west end, or throughout the residential neighborhoods that make up this Charleston County beach community. The island's proximity to James Island, Morris Island, and Charleston Harbor provides additional exploration and entertainment opportunities, while downtown Charleston's King Street, historic district, and waterfront restaurants remain just a short drive away.</p>
